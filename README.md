# 2 Outcome / Goal: 
Find a way to leverage social media alongside routinely collect government datasets to help address this health problem.

Interpretation: - 

# 3 What we did:
Data Journalism into investigating the the issue to 
Research what data is in the public space to understand the domain
Create a prototype web page with 
Social media images to build awareness - that this is a problem in the general public
Images could then be used in multiple media formats both digital and print

	Dataland NZ hackathon 31st aug -1 st Sep 2018
	5 guys chose the MOH Child Oral Health Challenge
	We’re pretty indecisive so we sort of fell into this awesome team


# 5 Initial Observations:
Short sprints as we didn’t know much about the problem space
We’re all tech, but limit on data kinda means no app
Strong AI / Data Visualization / Python / pragmatic team

# 6 Solution / Method:
What data is out there?
How can we visualize?
Now we have some things what do we want to generate / produce
Actual work
Images / infographics
Website (github.io)
Google slides
Presentation

# 11 Benefit:
Low cost
Education focus

# 12 Additional Recommendation:
More detailed analysis with Stats IDI data ( not publicly accessible)
Can’t id cause, but likely depreviation as primarily cause in complex space with education being a factor - social media
